              Thank you for considering donating to The Fuel Rats. As simple as our jobs are in the end,
              we actually have a lot of systems in place to help us do our rescues,
              and the servers they run on amount to over â‚¬100 per month.
            </p>
            <p>
              We've got rats who have fronted the money to keep these servers running,
              but if you'd like to contribute, that would be great!
            </p>
            <p>
              Our donations are processed through Stripe, and they take most major credit cards.
            </p>
