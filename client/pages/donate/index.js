            Thank you for considering a donation to The Fuel Rats. As simple as our jobs are, we have a lot of systems in place to help us do our rescues,
            and the servers they run on amount to over â‚¬100 per month. We have rats who have fronted the money to keep us running,
            but if you'd like to contribute, that would be great!
          `}
